## React practice from [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

I had a CORS problem when tried to use ipfy API directly from browser.
I didn't figure out how to make this work in some kind of elegant way, so
I set up a "proxy-server" in ./server/server.js (npm run server).
